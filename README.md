CFHelloWorld
============

This is a very simple Hello World CloudFoundry Example.

The manifest is more along the lines of a cf v5.

First setup your [Orion Settings for Cloud Deployment](https://orionhub.org/settings/settings.html#,category=Cloud).

For example you can set the API URL to CloudFoundry if you obtain an account there:

	API URL = https://api.run.pivotal.io

Or get an account at [BlueMix](https://ng.bluemix.net) and set the API URL to:

	API URL = https://api.ng.bluemix.net
	Manage URL = https://ace.ng.bluemix.net

[Clone this example into OrionHub](https://orionhub.org/git/git-repository.html#,createProject.name=CFHelloWorld,cloneGit=https://hub.jazz.net/git/spirit/CF.Hello.World), then Push the Deploy button
